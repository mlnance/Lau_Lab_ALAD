# PMB Rotation Albert Lau Lab
## Rotation Student: Morgan Nance
## Rotation Mentor: Alvin Yu

The goal of this rotation (and code) is to make edits to the string method used with the CHARMM software. Some potential modifications are as follows:
> Randomly pushing images of a cycle along a vector normal to the string
> Utilizing more information from the swarm (.swm) files in guiding image development
